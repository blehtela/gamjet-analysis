HOW TO RUN on Hefaistos:
------------------------
(try mosh to not drop connection)
- from local: 'rsync -rutP GamHistosFill.C GamHistosFill.h Hefaistos:/media/storage/gamjet/'
[- source /work/data/root/bin/thisroot.sh]
- source /work/data/rootbinaries/root/bin/thisroot.sh
- (rm *.d *.so *.pcm)
- root -l -b -q mk_CondFormats.C
- #define GPU in mk_GamHistosFill.C
=> edit (version, IOV_list) and execute 'python runAllIOVs.py'
[- nohup root -l -b -q mk_GamHistosFill.C > log.txt & ]
+ runtime about 12h, up from 9h (v19: 09:24 -> 21:18 18D2)
=> edit (version, IOV_list) and execute 'python renameAllIOVs.py'

+ tail -f log.txt
+ starting up takes quite a bit (~100 sec) due to GetEntries() call
   => code TStopWatch to ignore this startup time, or skip GetEntries
      (1M entries is just 0.1% ?! => 1.39B entries, about 3.4h runtime)

Local analysis:
- rsync -rutP files from Hefaistos
[  - rename GamHistosFill_mc_2016*APV to mc_2016APV* (automatize later)]
- python addAllIOVs.py
- root -l -b GamHistosMix.C+g
- root -l -b GamHistosRatio.C+g

Extra plotting
- root -l -b -q drawPhotonJetVsPtVsIOV.C
- root -l -b -q minitools/drawResponseVsRun.C
- root -l -b -q minitools/drawL2Res.C+g\(\"batchRun\"\)

CHANGELOG (latest first):
----------------------------
To-do later: 
- update h2r9vspt r9 binning. Check if r9 cut makes sense at pT>230 GeV for Photon200 trigger, and if efficiency drops too much

w45: first version to use V8M JECs.

--- NOTE: will not always list the changes here anymore --> for details on the different versions, see commits in github. ---

w29: start using hybrid JSON (i.e. golden + daily top-up), adding second rereco (2024C-ECALR-HCALDI).
w28: same as w27, but with previous golden json (27.5.).
w27: New offline pt cuts for photon triggers in time-control histograms (i.e. vs run-number). Also added some new TProfile2D histograms (vs pt vs eta) for gain1/gain6/gain12 studies in barrel region. Added new Photon_r9[i]<1.00 cut. Using new daily JSON from 02.06.2024, and according lumi information (calculated with brilcalc but without normtag). Also updated JEC and jetveto map.
w26: Using golden JSON (27.5.) to run 2024 prompt data. This is also the first version used for re-reco (ECALRATIO).
w25: Added hgam50t to control-directory (tight 50GeV photon trigger); updated daily JSON (27.5.); updated lumi-files accordingly; still using same jetveto and same JEC as previous versions.
w24: Same as w23, but used for running with golden json.
w23: Added time-stability histograms for high jet-eta regions (3 <= eta < 4 and 4<= eta < 5). Added use of HF branches (composition: EM vs hadronic). Use new daily json (22.5.).
w22: same as w22 but with lumi and json for golden json (16.5.)
w21: using bpix veto again (for jet and for photon, see bpixjv), added cross section histograms (pr50xs, etc.), 
        using integrated lumi calculated with brilcalc (this needs to be updated with each new JSON!), 
        updated to new JSON files (daily 19.5. and golden 16.5.); this code version is run with daily JSON.
w20: New Golden JSON (13.05.), otherwise identical to w17, w18 and w19.
w19: New Daily JSON (15.05.), otherwise same as w17 and w18.
w18: Golden JSON (03.05.), but with new version V2 of L2L3Residuals and jetvetomap. Otherwise like w17.
w17: New DAILY json (12.5.), more data; new L2L3Residual corrections (V2); new jetvetomap (V2). (data + json from 12.05.2024)
w16: Code unchanged (same as w15), but using new GOLDEN json. (data + json from 05./06.05.2024).
w15: New DAILY json and more data; new L2L3Residual corrections (Prompt24); new jetveto map (2024BC). (data + json from 05./06.05.2024).
w14: For runnng the code with Golden JSON (which was released in the morning of 30.04.2024).
w13: Using 2024Winter corrections for L2Relative jec, using daily JSON from 29.04.2024 (is the same as 28.04.2024)
w12: changed eta-binning in Gamjet2 folder (using now dijet narrow eta binning)
w11: first time running with 2024 data
w10: upper pT bins in some histograms were combined for better statistics. (might want to change this back?)
w9: applying jetvetomap also to photons (for all data periods: Cv123, Cv4, D)
w8: fixed bug --> using correct L2L3Res for the RunD data
w7: first run with new L2L3Res (29.02.2024)
w6: for running with L2Rel + L2Res (27.02.2024) on new QCD monte carlo
w5: used L2Rel + L2L3Res --> turned out to be not good (issue with L3-residuals)
w4: for running with L2Rel + L2Res (16.02.2024)
w3: used for running the bpix samples. Added line for setting jet phi, so that FactorizedJetCorrector does not complain. 
w2: changed JEC to Summer23Run3_V1_MC_L2Relative_AK4PUPPI.txt and for BPix samples Summer23BPixRun3_V1_MC_L2Relative_AK4PUPPI.txt respectively.
w1: first version including my updates - used to run on 2023 DATA (Cv123, Cv4, D) and 2023 MC (GJ-4Jets_HT* Summer23, and the same with BPix fix) (blehtela)

TO-DO LIST
-----------
- Complete implementation of PU reweighing. Add PU variations (systematic)
- Implement JER SF (once pT-dependent?). Add JER SF variations (systematic)
- Add parton shower weights (systematic)
- Add flavor corrections and its variations (systematic)


-- Correctgamscale seems critical for photon+jet. At low pT we probably don't have pT,e ~ pT,Z/2 anymore, and low pT photons may require more correction like high pT ones (quadratic shape with minimum at pT,Z~40 GeV). Should also calibrate with superclusters instead of electrons (track+EM more like track at low pT?)
** add veto on bad photon regions?

TBD:
- Investigate 1.5% leakage at high pT, photon vs PFphoton inconsistent? (h2phoj)
  - Could explain MPF lower than MPF1. Leakage also higher in data
- Add cut on maximum leakage at low pT to reduce QCD bkg? (h2phoj in data,MC)
  - do data/MC ratio of normalized leakage in pT bins 
- Investigate non-continuous H/E vs pT
- Veto photons near ECAL holes? And near SC boundaries? (h2gametaphi1,2)
  => at least ECAL holes, some missing from MC

tbd
- fix prhovsmu for data_Run2 => missing pileup_ASCII file from GPU machine?

tbd
+ reweight MC pileup (brilcalc for target profiles)
+ add JER SF

Plan:
- fix running over 2018A so get complete sample => done
  - increased nPhotonMax to 200, crashed with one event having 191
- implement JSON, rerun v3
  - /afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSCOMM/COMM_DQM/certification/Collisions18/13TeV/Legacy_2018/Cert_314472-325175_13TeV_Legacy2018_Collisions18_JSON.txt

- implement hotzones, rerun v4,v5
- implement JER SF, rerun v6 (MC only?)

To-do list:
- Check that runs on data => done
- Implement merging of 2018A,B,C,D => hadd (but in the future, give data luminosity weight for correct averaging?)
- Implement data/MC ratio => ok
- Run on full 2018 data and MC (flat?) => v1 ok, v2 on-going
- Implement photon corrections and uncertainties
   => 2018 MPFdata bit low, bal less different => photon footprint?
   - Look into photon jet minus photon minus L1RC. Separate CHF, NEF, NHF
- Jet and MET smearing? => careful, check shift on jet scales
- Rho vs pT mu etc.
- Select exactly one photon? => make plot of these vs pTgamma
- MET cleaning => done; add control plot
- Study photon seedGain vs pT, energyErr vs pT, hoe vs pT, r9 vs pT
- Check photon eta-phi distribution to locate hot/cold zones => draft, update
- Compare to Higgs to gamma gamma workflow

Lucas Torterotot, latest talk on gamma+jet I could find (29 July 2019, EOY18):
- https://indico.cern.ch/event/837707/#10-gamma-jet-l3res-for-2018-v1
Code through Stephanie:
- https://github.com/lucastorterotot/DijetRootTreeMaker/blob/master/instructions/GammaJetTree_Instruction.md

Latest runs v2, v3 (trig+JSON; all in parallel, except 2018a in v2 and MC in v3)
- 2018A: runtime 3453 sec. => 6387 s (alone) / 9307 s (~14/fb)
- 2018B: runtime 5169 sec. => 6167 s / 6262 s (~7.1/fb)
- 2018C: runtime 5110 sec. => 6102 s / 6217 s (~6.9/fb)
- 2018D: runtime 14631 sec. => 14834 s / 16220 s (~31/fb)
- 2018MC: runtime 1075 sec. => 910 s / 452 s (alone)
=> would be justified to split 2018D in two to go from 4.1h to 2.1h

  - return false; for event selection

  - inputList = ROOT.TList() kommunikoi C++:aan

Observations:
- bit trick to compile and run on Hefaistos, differet ROOT version?
- HLT_Photon[100,110,120]EB_TightID_TightIso correspond to a lot of statistics in midrange, but are apparently not active in all of 2018 data => anything replacing them?
- can remove HLT_Photon100EBHE10, HLT_Photon100EEHE10, HLT_Photon100EE_TightID_TightIso also, not always active and not used at the moment
- data has 1.4B events, takes a lot of time to run (16.6h). Photon triggers are only a fraction of this. As a quick fix, activate trigger pre-selection for data
- first run took 51326 sec (14.5h), crashed before starting MC, but writing file succeeded (or not?)
- HLT_PhotonXX pass through some noise at 200 GeV that 110T does not?
